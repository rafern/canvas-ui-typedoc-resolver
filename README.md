# canvas-ui-typedoc-resolver

Resolves TypeDoc third-party symbols to
[canvas-ui](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui) classes, interfaces, enums,
etc... TypeDoc can't normally resolve these symbols, so this plugin manually
resolves them so that there can be a more seamless
([albeit imperfect](#known-issues)) documentation.

Mostly only used for canvas-ui integration libraries such as:
- [canvas-ui-three](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui-three)
- [canvas-ui-wl](https://github.com/rafern/canvas-ui-wl)

## Known issues

The resolver doesn't work for `@link` tags
([issue](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/2030)). This is also
caused by `@link` tags generated by canvas-ui being reintroduced into the
documentation due to extending a canvas-ui class; for example:

- `canvas-ui` defines a function `myFunction`
- `canvas-ui` defines a class `MyClass` with a property `myProperty`, where the property has a `@link` tag to `myFunction` in its docstring
- `canvas-ui-plugin` defines a class `MyExtendedClass` which extends `MyClass`

Despite `myProperty` not being defined by the `canvas-ui-plugin` library, it is
still included in the `canvas-ui-plugin` documentation because it's part of
`MyExtendedClass`, which has a `@link` tag to `canvas-ui`'s `myFunction`, which
creates a broken link and a warning.
